###This dataset is for modelling in-play football team strength models, such as [Dixon and Robinson (1998)](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~ejm/M3S4/Problems/football.pdf), it contains in-play goals of each match of the English Premier League.

For each file, the goals are stored in the columns with index, each column is a goal, in the format (goal scoring minute, goal scored by home or away team, goal scorer).

E.g. (59, 0, 'Mark Hughes') is

* 59: goal scored at 59th minute
* 0: goal scored by home team (1: goal scored by away team)
* 'Mark Hughes': the goal scorer
